{"name":"Downplay","tagline":"Simple markup for stage plays","body":"### Welcome to Downplay.\r\n\r\nDownplay is a simple markup syntax for writing, editing and sharing stage plays in plain, human-readable text. Using any text editor, you can write your stage play without worrying about formatting and instead focus on the words, dialogue and action that will bring your play to life.\r\n\r\nSimilar to other markup syntaxes like John Gruber’s [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a general purpose markup syntax), or [Fountain](http://fountain.io) (a screenplay specific markup syntax), Downplay files are  readable, editable, and writable with the minimal markup not getting in the way of your work. Your writing will look and feel like a stage play, and when you're done, you can export it to a markdown parser that will format it to look exactly the way plays are meant to look.\r\n\r\nBecause it’s just text, Downplay is also a great format for archiving plays without worry of file-format obsolescence or incompatibility. \r\n\r\n### What's Included?\r\n\r\nThe first version of Downplay supports the basics of getting your play written. This includes:\r\n**#**  - Act\r\n**$**  - Scene\r\n**<**  - Setting\r\n**>**  - Blackout/Curtain/End\r\n**@**  - Character Names\r\n**(**  - Stage Direction\r\nNo markup for Dialogue\r\n\r\n### What's Not Included\r\nDownplay doesn't attempt to create the Title or Cast of Characters pages. Yet.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDownplay was created by @barach and was inspired by playing around with [Ulysses III](http://www.ulyssesapp.com) in trying to set it up for writing plays. Included in the GitHub repository are templates and styles for use with Ulysses and hopefully others will be coming soon. In an effort to make this much more usable across more editors, I hope to create (help welcome) a parser and whatever else is needed for developers to incorporate the Downplay syntax.\r\n","google":"UA-53014244-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
